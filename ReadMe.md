# Web app with Streamlit

Streamlit is a python library that enables you to visualize large Datasets into interactive graphs. This project uses the Dataset of Motor-Vehicle-collision-New-York. 

This project can be extended to a very large extent i.e. interactively plotting the Sensitivity and outputs of any Deep Learning model in real time
